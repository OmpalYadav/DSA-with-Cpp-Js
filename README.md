## 📖 About This Repo

This repository is not just a bunch of code files — it’s my **daily DSA grind**, a **learning journal**, and a step-by-step roadmap towards becoming a **product-ready developer**.

Here, I practice **C++** for competitive depth and **JavaScript** for practical coding skills.
Every day = new concepts, new problems, and consistent progress.
